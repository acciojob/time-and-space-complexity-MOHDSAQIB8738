	<h1>Time complexity is a function that describes how long an algorithm takes in terms of the quantity of input it receives. Space complexity is a function that describes how much memory (space) an algorithm requires to the quantity of input to the method.</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to execute as a function of its input size. It is an essential factor in determining the performance and scalability of a program, as inefficient algorithms can lead to slow execution times and unresponsive applications.</b></p>
    <p><b>Space complexity is essentially a parallel concept to time complexity. If you need to create an array of size n, this will take O(n) space. If you build a two-dimensional array of size n*n, this will need O(n2) space. Space complexity is dependent on several factors.</p>
