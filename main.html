	<h1>Time And Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to execute as a function of its input size. It is an essential factor in determining the performance and scalability of a program, as inefficient algorithms can lead to slow execution times and unresponsive applications.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the size of the input data.Space Complexity is often expressed using big O notation, such as O(n), to describe how the memory requirements grow with me input size.</p>
